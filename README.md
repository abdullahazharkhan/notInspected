NotInspected is a simple browser extension that allows you to edit and save content on web pages temporarily. The extension has two buttons: "Edit" and "Save". Clicking on the "Edit" button makes the active web page editable, enabling you to modify text. Once editing is complete, you can click the "Save" button to save the changes made to the content.
